# Example codes of TCD's online programming test
In 2024 Fall application, Applicants who applied for MSc Computer Science programme in Trinity College Dublin will receive an email, inviting them to attend a online programming test held by [TestDome](https://www.testdome.com/).
Applicants could choose only one from C, C++ and Java as test language, and there were 3 questions randomly selected from the [TestDome Library](https://www.testdome.com/library?page=1).
Some of them required premium user privilege, and no answers were provided.
I chose Java as test language, and my questions were: `Calories Burned`, `Segment` and `Tiles`.
As for C++ code, they were provided by a friend of mine, who applied for this programme last year.
